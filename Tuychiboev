my final work is in lastlast.php;
database name: 23db359;
in my zip file there is connect.php i donw know should it be included or not;


when it comes to web, when you press delete button it deletes the row you choose and when you click edit button you will have a window which is id number is readonly, and the other values are initialized and can be editted, add function works properly.
